Hi, my name is Sreehari Prasad and this my blog. I don't know how to introduce myself. I don't have any notable achievements or a thrilling backstory, but hey, I do own a 7 kg fully automatic top-loaded Samsung washing machine. That should amount to something, right? Apart from that, I really like computers. I like spending time with them, modifying them, and one day, I hope I become one of the conductors of this giant ensemble that they're creating. I'm just romanticizing things; I just want to be a developer, the good kind, the ones who know that it's just a job but give that small extra pinch of passion into their works. 

oh! and i like watching shows, playing videos games, ignoring sports and loving my friends and family, byeeeeeeeeðŸ‘‹
